It is tiny Java based project to read and write pipe separated files. we can apply some rules on the file using their row number, column names and their new values.

It uses Java Swings for UI. It is only a utility program to assist test case creation and eliminates some manual actions.

It was written to learn desktop UI creation in java while adding some value to existing office work on flat files.
